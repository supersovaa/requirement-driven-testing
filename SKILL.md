# Requirement-driven testing

Use this skill when implementing or changing behavior governed by settled requirements or design, and when implementation review finds missing or insufficient tests.

Treat tests as executable evidence of established requirements and design rather than as a source for inventing them.

## Keep requirement and design tests distinct

Derive requirement tests from settled requirements.
Use them to verify externally meaningful behavior, outcomes, constraints, and other requirement-level guarantees.

Derive design tests from settled design.
Use them when APIs, invariants, type guarantees, responsibility boundaries, or other design contracts need executable verification.

Requirements take precedence over design, tests, and implementation.
When settled design conflicts with a settled requirement, do not preserve or test the conflicting design.
Return the conflict to the workflow that owns design so the design can be aligned with the requirement before relying on it for implementation or design tests.
Leave requirement changes to the workflow that owns requirements.

Do not test implementation details merely because they exist.
Test an internal type, structure, or procedure directly only when it carries an established design guarantee.

## Reuse sufficient coverage

Before adding a test, inspect existing tests for the guarantee being established.

When an existing test already provides sufficient evidence for the requirement or design contract, use that evidence instead of adding a duplicate test.
Do not treat incidental execution of a path as sufficient coverage unless the test actually establishes the relevant guarantee.

## Establish tests before target implementation

Establish missing executable tests before the target implementation when the guarantee can be meaningfully tested.
Defer test creation only when a required production dependency prevents the scenario from executing meaningfully, or when the guarantee is not reasonably executable as a test.

For a new or changed requirement-level behavior:

1. Identify the smallest observable scenario that demonstrates the requirement.
2. Add or select the test that establishes that scenario.
3. Run it before the target implementation.
4. If the required behavior is not already satisfied, confirm that the test fails because that behavior is missing.
5. If the test already passes, verify that the existing behavior genuinely satisfies the requirement instead of manufacturing a failure.
6. Implement any remaining required behavior.
7. Run the requirement test and relevant regression tests until they pass.

Apply the same ordering to design tests when an established design contract needs direct executable evidence.

A failure is useful pre-implementation evidence only when it is caused by the missing target behavior or contract.

## Distinguish test-support gaps from implementation dependencies

When a test cannot be expressed because test fixtures, builders, deterministic inputs, or other test-support boundaries are missing, establish the minimum test support needed before the target implementation.

Do not use test support to fake a missing production dependency or predecessor behavior.
When the target scenario cannot meaningfully execute because required production behavior is not yet available, treat that as an implementation dependency and return it to the workflow that owns planning or execution readiness.

When a settled requirement does not determine an expected result, do not invent one in a test.
Return the ambiguity to the workflow that owns the requirement.

## Prioritize review-discovered test gaps

When implementation review finds that an established requirement or design contract lacks sufficient test evidence, close that test gap before ordinary cleanup or refactoring, except for prerequisites needed to build or run the tests.

When the implementation is incorrect, first add or strengthen a test that demonstrates the missing guarantee, then fix the implementation.

When the implementation is already correct and only the evidence is missing, a newly added review-remediation test may pass on its first run.

After closing the gap, use the resulting tests as regression protection for the remaining review fixes.

## Preserve repository conventions

Use the repository's established test framework, fixture structure, naming, placement, and traceability conventions.
Do not introduce a new documentation or mapping format when the repository already has one that can express the required relationship.

This skill owns deriving and restoring executable test evidence from settled requirements and design.
Requirement definition, design definition, implementation planning, implementation execution, and implementation review remain with their owning workflows.
